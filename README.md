# Brain Marks

This app has always been open source! It began with the [Big Brain Hackathon](https://bigbrainhacks.com) and now during [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com). It is available for free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brain-marks/id1577423925). This app uses the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) (v2 where possible) and [AWS Amplify DataStore](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/ios/) (soon to be removed).


**Sadly due to [Twitter API changes](https://twitter.com/mikaela__caron/status/1621513256337805314?s=61&t=qApWO_A42TJZ0V-Z2oIjmQ), this app will no longer be open for contributions. Thank you to everyone who took the time to contribute!**

# Getting Started
* You will need an API key from the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api)
* If your feature/change requires changing the model you will need to know [AWS Amplify DataStore](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/ios/) - soon to be deprecated
* Browse the open [issues](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/brain-marks/issues) and comment which you would like to work on
   * A maintainer will assign that issue to you to indicate to others this issue is being worked on, to prevent overlapping work
   * You can only be assigned **ONE** issue at a time
* Fork this repo
* Clone your repo and move into that directory
* Checkout a new branch (from the `dev` branch) to work on an issue:
   * `git checkout -b issueNumber-feature-name`
   * example: `git checkout -b 134-french-localization`

* Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/brain-marks/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started) to setup the project.
* Once you complete an issue: Open your forked repo in your browser and create a PR to the `dev` branch of this repository
> Be sure to squash your commits into one single commit, how to do that shown [here](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/squash-commits-into-one-git)
